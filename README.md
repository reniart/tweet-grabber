# Tweet-Grabber
Grabs liked tweets from my twitter page and posts them in my discord server aka meaningless automation

took an embarrasingly long time to finish given how simple it is


TODO: (might never happen)
find a way to only pull tweets from twitter that havent been sent, as opposed to pulling all tweets and only sending new ones
