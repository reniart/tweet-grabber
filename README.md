# Tweet-Grabber
Grabs liked tweets from my twitter page and posts them in my discord server aka meaningless automation

took an embarrasingly long time to finish given how simple it is


TODO: (might never happen)
if you dislike the latest tweet from the last cycle it will break the bot and just send every liked tweet
find a way to only pull tweets from twitter that havent been sent, as opposed to pulling all tweets and only sending new ones
should probably use something other than json to store tweet data
